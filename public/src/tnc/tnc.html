                    <p>Before you instruct us to act in the sale of your property, we wish to draw your attention to our Terms
                        of Business. The Property Buying Company can offer an average completion timescale for a standard
                        property purchase is 3 to 4 weeks subject to survey. We have however completed purchases in as little
                        as 7 days.

                    <p>
                        A valuation of the property will be instructed prior to the sale being completed at our cost by independent RICS surveyor.
                        We also often also instruct a high street estate agent to give us a market appraisal for your property
                        too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Should it be necessary, we will also acquire a builders report at our discretion together with additional searches against
                        the property as necessary.

                        As we are a trade buyer of properties we do not pay the full market value of a property. The price we can pay for a property
                        depends on the property type, area, condition, age and construction type and is subject to final
                        valuation of which up to 80% of the property value is paid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our initial offer is conditional upon final survey and is subject to any adverse entries being revealed in the searches carried
                        out against the property and any other matters which are subsequently revealed to us which would
                        affect the market value of the property.
